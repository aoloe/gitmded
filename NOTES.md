- use the locally installed git
- the TOC is managed in form of a yaml file, which can als be manually edited
- if a local change conflicts with a remote one, give some choices, but mainly backup the local one, pull the remote and then allow to manually merge them
- add a text field "what i'm doing" which is used for commit messages
- manage the attachments (images)
